# TIC-TAC-TOE game


## Gameplay
1. The Board:

   * You have a 3x3 grid (a total of 9 squares).
   * Each square represents a spot where you can place your mark.

2. Players:

   * Tic-Tac-Toe is typically played by two players (a player and a computer on this site).
   * One player uses “X,” and the other uses “O.”

3. Objective:

   * The goal is to get three of your marks in a row: either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

4. Turns:
   * Players take turns placing their marks on the empty squares.
   * The starting player (usually “X”) alternates with each new game.

5. Winning:

   * If a player manages to get three of their marks in a row, they win!
   * The winning line can be:
   * Horizontal (across a row)
   * Vertical (down a column)
   * Diagonal (from one corner to the opposite corner)

6. Ties:

   * If all nine squares are filled, and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

7. Zero-Sum Game:

   * Tic-Tac-Toe is a zero-sum game. This means that if both players play optimally, the game will always end in a tie.
   * However, with some simple strategies, you can increase your chances of winning.

# Development
This part is dedicated to the page's development.

## The Development process
The Development of this site includes consequently following the stages described in detail in the next sections:

* Requirements gathering described in Strategy Plane – gathering all requirements to the Site. User Stories belong to this stage.
* Scope definition described in Scope Plane – defining what will be included in the first release.
* At the start of the design comes the Structure plane, where wireframes are used to design sketches of the pages.
* The result of a Skeleton plane is the Site’s navigation.
* The last in Development comes the Surface plane, where all design is completed for various screen sizes and audiences. This plane includes all JavaScript functionality.
* Then comes the Site testing, which is performed manually using Jigsaw (CSS) and W3 Validator (HTML). Google’s Lighthouse test is used to test the site’s performance.
The site's functionality development falls under Test Driven Development (TDD) and is tested using JEST.
