# TIC-TAC-TOE game


## Gameplay
1. The Board:

   * You have a 3x3 grid (a total of 9 squares).
   * Each square represents a spot where you can place your mark.

2. Players:

   * Tic-Tac-Toe is typically played by two players (a player and a computer on this site).
   * One player uses “X,” and the other uses “O.” 

3. Objective:

   * The goal is to get three of your marks in a row: either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

4. Turns:
   * Players take turns placing their marks on the empty squares.
   * The starting player (usually “X”) alternates with each new game.

5. Winning:
    
   * If a player manages to get three of their marks in a row, they win!
   * The winning line can be:
   * Horizontal (across a row)
   * Vertical (down a column)
   * Diagonal (from one corner to the opposite corner)

6. Ties:

   * If all nine squares are filled, and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

7. Zero-Sum Game:

    * Tic-Tac-Toe is a zero-sum game. This means that if both players play optimally, the game will always end in a tie.
    * However, with some simple strategies, you can increase your chances of winning.
